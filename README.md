## [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/)

Apparently I'm doing this in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) this year.

Some days may include additional implementations in other languages or other extra stuff such as benchmarks.

The main solution will always be in a file called solution.cr and that will read the input from stdin. To compile & run the solutions (assuming crystal is installed), any of these commands seem to do the trick:

* ```$ crystal run solution.cr -- input.txt```

* ```$ cat input.txt | crystal run solution.cr```

* ```$ crystal solution.cr input.txt```

* ```$ crystal solution.cr``` and manually type/paste input, ending with EOF (Ctrl+D)
